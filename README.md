I wrote many chemistry documents in school. Here are some examples you might find useful.
You can read more about it on my blog.

I have added some commands to the package pst-labo.
You can invoke this two diff commands to have a look. The current files from texlive are maybe somewhere else located on your machine.

```Shell
diff pst-labo/pst-labo.tex /usr/local/texlive/current/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pst-labo/pst-labo.tex
diff pst-labo/pst-laboObj.tex /usr/local/texlive/current/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pst-labo/pst-laboObj.tex
```
